These project regard libraries for the simulation of hard shaped bodies. At the 
moment, it contains some libraries for detecting overlaps in 2d

LIBS:
apart openinventor and plplot (plplot9-driver-xwin on Ubuntu), check that freeglut3-dev is installed

TODO:
	The project needs to be configured with AUTOTOOLS in order to be able to be installed. 
	At the moment, a very primitive MAKEFILE structure is used


DIRECTORIES:

* VecNd
	Basic libraries for double and integer vectors in 2d and 3d. Integer vectors 
	are useful fo the construction of periodic cells. 

* SE2d
	Basic libraries for detecting overlaps among shaped 2d objects:
	- circles: OV,DS
	- lines: OV,DS
	- spherical caps: OV,DS
	- oriented rectangles : OV
	- ellipses: OV
	- super-ellipses: OV
	(OV means the presence of routines for the overlap, DS for the distance)

* wrap_plplot
	wrapper for the plplot 2d graphic libraries libraries 
	(http://plplot.sourceforge.net/), useful to visualise and debug the code

* LLcells
	templates for the linked-list cell structure useful for many-particles 
	simulations

* MC-SE2d
	this is the core of a Monte Carlo simulation of 2d shaped particles

* test
	some test that the code is functioning
	
* NOTES
	some preliminary technical notes (text in lyx, figures in xfig)
