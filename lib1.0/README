These project regard libraries for the simulation of hard shaped bodies. At the 
moment, it contains some libraries for detecting overlaps in 2d

LIBS:
apart openinventor and plplot (plplot9-driver-xwin on Ubuntu), check that freeglut3-dev is installed

TODO:
	The project needs to be configured with AUTOTOOLS in order to be able to be installed. 
	At the moment, it assumes that GSL (gnu scientific libraries) and PLPLOT libraries 
	are installed


DIRECTORIES:

* include
	all the headers
	vector2d.h: Basic template library for vectors in 2d and 3d. Integer vectors 
	are useful fo the construction of periodic cells. 
	LLcells2d.h: template library for linked list cells
	
* lib
	libSE2d.a: basic libraries for detecting overlaps among shaped 2d objects:
	- circles: OV,DS
	- lines: OV,DS
	- spherical caps: OV,DS
	- oriented rectangles : OV
	- ellipses: OV
	- super-ellipses: OV
	(OV means the presence of routines for the overlap, DS for the distance)
	libWrapPlplot.a: wrapper for the plplot 2d graphic libraries libraries 
	(http://plplot.sourceforge.net/), useful to visualise and debug the code


* src
	some test that the code is functioning
	this is the core of a Monte Carlo simulation of 2d shaped particles
	
* NOTES
	some preliminary technical notes (text in lyx, figures in xfig)
